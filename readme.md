# Image Tampering Detection using Python

I have created this repository for detecting image tampering using Python. The notebook covers the following key steps:

1. **Image Import and Preprocessing**: Images provided by the user are imported and their size and format are checked. The images are then converted to grayscale for further processing.

2. **Similarity Index Calculation**: The similarity index between the original and tampered images is computed using a suitable metric, allowing us to quantify the level of alteration.

3. **Thresholding for Detection**: Thresholding techniques are applied to the images to enhance differences between the original and tampered regions, making tampering easier to detect.

4. **Contour Detection and Extraction**: Contours are identified in the thresholded images using the `imutils` library. These contours are then extracted and analyzed.

5. **Visualization and Comparison**: The notebook generates visualizations to aid in the detection process. It plots the original image, tampered image, difference map, thresholded images, and extracted contours for easy comparison.

6. **Tampering Assessment**: The tampering detection process concludes with a comparison of the similarity score and visual evidence. If the similarity score falls below a certain threshold, the image is flagged as potentially tampered.

## Requirements

To run the notebook successfully, you'll need the following Python libraries:

- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- imutils

You can install these dependencies using the following command:

```
pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib imutils
```

## Note

This project is meant for educational and demonstrative purposes. While the techniques employed here can be useful in identifying certain forms of image tampering, it may not be foolproof and may require further refinement for more complex scenarios.

Feel free to contribute, improve, or adapt this code for your specific needs.
